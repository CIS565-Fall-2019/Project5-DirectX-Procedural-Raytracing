### Introduction
The project aims at doing ray tracing rendering of a scene using DXR API. The steps in the project helped to learn how the pipeline is generated by using CPU code and how the logic for rendering is written using GPU kernels and parallel computation is used for processing. The readme gives the brief understanding about the raytracing, about the CPU and GPU codes and finally a performace analysis of the DRX rattrcing with vrying the maximum depth of a ray. I have included some bloopers in the end to mention some of my mistakes I was ding while coding in the project.
